### About

This is a gradle plugin that integrates Dyson and Ngrok to start a fake server and expose it's public URL to later inject it on your application.

The goal for doing that is being able to test mobile applications performing requests to a fake server inside a device test lab (Firebase's, Amazon's...)

### Setup

This plugin is under active development, so it's not available publicly yet.
